## **Introduction**

In this repository, we explore how Apache Airflow can be leveraged with Python for various data engineering tasks. Airflow is a powerful tool that allows you to programmatically define, schedule, and monitor workflows using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). We will walk through setting up Airflow, creating DAGs, and working with real-world data processing pipelines.

## **Features**

- **Data Pipelines**: Automate complex ETL jobs using Airflow.
- **Scheduling**: Use Airflow's scheduler to automate jobs at specified intervals (e.g., daily, monthly).
- **Extensibility**: Integrate with databases, APIs, and other external systems.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor task execution through Airflow's web UI.

## **Why Airflow?**

- **Scalability**: Easily scale your workflows as your data grows.
- **Modularity**: Break down workflows into smaller tasks and build complex data processing jobs.
- **Flexibility**: Airflow supports Python, giving you full flexibility to work with various libraries and tools.
- **UI for Monitoring**: Airflow provides a user-friendly interface to track the success or failure of tasks.

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Apache Airflow
- SQLite (for the local database or your preferred database)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployments)

### **2. Installation**

To set up Airflow on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Install Apache Airflow using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install apache-airflow
