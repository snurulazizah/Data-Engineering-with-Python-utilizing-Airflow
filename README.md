Introduction
Apache Airflow is an open-source platform designed for authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. In data engineering, it plays a crucial role by allowing users to orchestrate ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs and manage data pipelines efficiently.

This repository will guide you through setting up Apache Airflow with Python for data engineering tasks. You will learn how to build and automate data pipelines, schedule jobs, and handle dependencies.

Why Use Apache Airflow for Data Engineering?
Scalability: Airflow is highly scalable and can handle complex pipelines with large datasets.
Extensibility: You can use Python to extend Airflow’s functionality, integrating it with databases, APIs, and more.
Scheduling and Monitoring: Airflow provides a rich user interface to monitor and schedule jobs efficiently.
Modularity: With DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), workflows can be broken down into tasks and scheduled with clear dependencies.
Prerequisites
To work with Airflow and Python for data engineering, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.7+ installed
Apache Airflow installed (we’ll guide you through the process below)
Basic understanding of Python and data engineering concepts
Docker (optional, for containerized deployments)
Setup Instructions
1. Install Airflow
First, we need to install Airflow and its dependencies. You can do this by using the following commands:

bash
Salin kode
pip install apache-airflow
For Docker-based setup, use the official Airflow Docker image:

bash
Salin kode
docker-compose -f airflow/docker-compose.yaml up
2. Set Up Airflow Configuration
Once Airflow is installed, set up the necessary environment variables and configurations. For example, set the AIRFLOW_HOME directory:

bash
Salin kode
export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow
Next, initialize the Airflow database and create the necessary tables:

bash
Salin kode
airflow db init
3. Create Airflow DAGs
Create a folder named dags inside the Airflow home directory:

bash
Salin kode
mkdir $AIRFLOW_HOME/dags
You can now define your Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in this folder to manage data workflows.

Example Use Case
This section will walk through an example data engineering pipeline with Airflow and Python.

1. Building a Data Pipeline
In this pipeline, we will fetch raw loan data, clean it, and store it in a database. The pipeline is divided into multiple stages using Airflow tasks.

Create a new file loan_data_pipeline.py under the dags folder.

python
Salin kode
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def fetch_data():
    # Function to fetch raw data (e.g., from an API or a file)
    pass

def clean_data():
    # Function to clean and preprocess the data
    pass

def load_data():
    # Function to load cleaned data into a database
    pass

with DAG('loan_data_pipeline',
         start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
         schedule_interval='@daily',
         catchup=False) as dag:

    fetch_task = PythonOperator(task_id='fetch_data_task', python_callable=fetch_data)
    clean_task = PythonOperator(task_id='clean_data_task', python_callable=clean_data)
    load_task = PythonOperator(task_id='load_data_task', python_callable=load_data)

    fetch_task >> clean_task >> load_task
2. Cleaning and Transforming Data
python
Salin kode
import pandas as pd

def clean_data():
    df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/raw_data.csv')
    df = df.dropna()  # Remove missing values
    df.to_csv('/path/to/cleaned_data.csv', index=False)
3. Loading Data into a Database
python
Salin kode
import sqlite3

def load_data():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('/path/to/database.db')
    df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/cleaned_data.csv')
    df.to_sql('loan_data', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)
    conn.close()
